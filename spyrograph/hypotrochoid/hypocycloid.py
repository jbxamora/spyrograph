    Model of a hypocycloid, which is a mathematical curve traced by a point on a circle as
    it rolls around the inside of another fixed circle. This class represents a special case of
    a hypotrochoid, where the distance from the point to the rolling circle is equal to the radius
    of the rolling circle.

    The Hypocycloid class allows you to generate points along the curve using mathematical
    equations and visualize the curve in a plot. It also provides properties and methods for
    computing the length, area, and curvature of the curve, as well as for plotting and animating
    the curve.

    The Hypocycloid class is a useful tool for exploring the properties and behaviors of hypocycloids,
    and can be used in a variety of applications such as in mechanical engineering and mathematics
    education. If you need to work with hypocycloids for a project or research, the Hypocycloid class
    provides a simple and intuitive interface to generate these curves and explore their properties.
